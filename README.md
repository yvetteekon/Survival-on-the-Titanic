# Survival-on-the-Titanic
A predictive model to determine survival on the Titanic

### Models built
... Decision Tree (CART Model)
... Random Forest Model
... Conditional Inference Tree Model
... Logistic Model

### "Best" Model
The model with highest predictive accuracy (0.81) on the Kaggle leaderboard was the Conditional Inference Tree Model

### Imbalanced Data
... Applied SMOTE to data set to deal with imbalanced classes in the data set but it didn't improve my models predictive accuracy significantly. 
... Decision Tree Models work quite well with imbalanced data sets
